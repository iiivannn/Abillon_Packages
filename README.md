# Widget Tree

<br>
This widget tree features the use of single child scroll view. This enables the scrolling of the app just like a news feed.<br>
It uses a reusable class, MyCard, that allows us to make elements like a post in a news feed. This post is clickable using a button<br>
where you will be prompted to another screen if you click the button.<br>

<br>
This is the reusable MyCard class which requires such variables to be used in various elements in the news feed.

<br>
This widget tree is the second dart file which indicates the screen that you will be prompted if you click the button.<br>
This also requires variables that will also be used inside the second screen to indicate its content.
<br><br>

All in all, the app uses two packages: Gap and Transition. It features the Fade, Scale, and Left-To-Right transition of the Transition package. While the gap function is featured along the my card classes to give gap among the elements.<br><br>
